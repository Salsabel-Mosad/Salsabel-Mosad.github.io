My Name is Salsabel Mosad, and I’m 21 years old, a student in the
Computer Engineering and Control Systems Department at the Faculty of
Engineering, Mansoura University. I’m interested in learning Penetration
Testing, and currently, I’m focusing on web and network Penetration
Testing. I have created this blog to share what I learn, hoping that it
may benefit anyone interested in my field.
